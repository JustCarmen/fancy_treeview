Version 1.4.4 - 11-2013
This version is equal to version 1.2.1. I just updated the version number in order to join the webtrees version numbers. 
This version of the module can be used on the webtrees 1.4x branch.
=========================================================================================================================

Version 1.2.1 - 09-10-2013
* Bug fix. If there is not a lot of text in a family entry and the image size is larger than the min-height, the subsequent sibling-family slides into that entry. So the layout gets destroyed. Fixed.

=========================================================================================================================
Version 1.2 - 08-10-2013
* Bug fix pointer to base/menu.css removed. There is no menu.css in the base folder.
* Added German translation for 'were divorced' (wurden geschieden).
* New feature: Added options for thumbnails (thumb size and square thumbs as option)
* New feature: Added option to show userform on frontpage. With this form the user can set another startperson.

=========================================================================================================================
Version 1.1.1 - 01-08-2013
* Bug fix in help_text for select country. The word country was misspelled in the 3rd line.
* Bug fix in gettext string: "..are divorced" must be "..were divorced".
* Bug fix. Php error in function print_page solved.

==========================================================================================================================
Version 1.1 - 31-07-2013
* New feature: Load a predefined number of generation blocks at page start. This is a solution for large trees. Choose between 1 to 10 or all generation blocks to load at once.
  Extra blocks will be loaded when clicking on the button below each page or by clicking on a 'follow' link in the last visible generation block without page refresh.
* Re-added improved version of the check relationship function (removed in version 1.0.7). Indicate relationship between partners. Option can be turned on and off in the admin. 
* Better function to count spouses - Thanks to Carl Scase.
* Bug Fix. Fixed the wrong counter increment in the browser Opera. Solved by placing an extra dot after the numbers in the counter increment style in base.css.
* New: Added divorce information.
* Bug Fix: non-married couples with children were shown as married. If a non-married couple has children, the children's list is shown as before.
  Extra information about the partner (father/mother of the children) is added in a tooltip.
* removed variable $presume_death. Use the build-in function isDead() instead.
* Changed some function names to know better what they do.
* Bug fix. The print date function went wrong when a date like 'between january 1800 and december 1800' was used.
  Improved the function print date. First check if a qualifier is set before the month/year check.
* New: Norwegian Language File. Thanks to Thomas Rindal.

==========================================================================================================================
Version 1.0.7 - 13-07-2013
* Bugfix: Removed the check_relationship function (added in 1.0.5). It turns out to be really slow on large trees.

==========================================================================================================================
Version 1.0.6 - 11-07-2013
* Bugfix: If updated from a previous version but not in sequence, the db_schemes fails. Changed the db_schemes.

==========================================================================================================================
Version 1.0.5 - 10-07-2013
* New feature: Show single persons (persons without partner and children) in each generation block with full details.
  This is an optional feature. Option can be turned on and off on the configuration page.
* Added extra class dynamically through jQuery for parent blocks with images. The css setting min-height is now only set on these blocks.
  This prevents blocks without images from having to much empty space. This mostly happens when the option 'show single persons' is turned on.
* Added some extra space on the top and bottom of the main blockcontent.
* Bugfix: Do not show a family block where the main person is a child with one or both parents listed in the same generation block. 
  If this is the case the children will be listed in the next generation anyway. This prevents double listing of the same person and all his/her next generations.
* New feature: Check blood ties (relationship) between partners. If they are members of the same family branche add the relationship-name after the spouse' name between brackets.	
* Added updated French and German language files.

==========================================================================================================================

* Added updated French and German language files.
* Bug fix. Reverted back the in version 1.0.3. added feature to change the text on the submenu links. This is not the right way to do this, because the

* Added a new option to get the root persons' fullname in the menu link.
* Have made the surname editable (only when use fullname is unchecked).
* Changed some markup for W3C validation.
